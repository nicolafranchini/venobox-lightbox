# ℹ️ Migration Notice: VenoBox-WP

This repository was a fork used for my collaboration with [Neil Gee](https://github.com/neilgee/venobox) on the **VenoBox Lightbox** plugin.

As the author of the original [VenoBox JS script](https://github.com/nicolafranchini/VenoBox), I have launched my own official WordPress integration: **VenoBox-WP**. 

### Why switch to VenoBox-WP?
*   **Vanilla JS:** Built with the latest version of VenoBox (no jQuery dependency).
*   **Official Support:** Directly maintained by the core script author.
*   **Fully Updated:** Optimized for the latest WordPress releases and modern web standards.

While the original plugin by Neil Gee remains available, I will be focusing all future development and support exclusively on the new official version.
